## Inspiration
Startups and small businesses have been hit severely due to COVID-19. They donâ€™t have enough resources to reach out for help or to connect with investors. Not all startups are making millions of dollars in growth every year to present their product to a shark tank for more investment.

Meanwhile, most people are not billionaires but want to invest.

So, we wanted to build a platform that benefits small businesses from the perspective of both crowdfunding seekers and investors.

## How it works
Simply Start: An app that promotes small businesses and leverages the power & success of women entrepreneurs and businesses of color by helping them get crowdfunding by retail investors for equity.

### App walkthrough

   - User starts by logging in after authentication via their personalized username and password. Each session of the user login generates a personalized API token, which helps maintain a secure environment for their activity on the application.
    - After logging in, the user is greeted by a personalized login page containing the user's total investments. It shows the startups they could invest in and their favorite small businesses.
    - What makes our app stand out is the "highlights" feature of our platform. Each month we pick the "Business of the Month" to promote underrepresented and discriminated businesses. This is a massive problem in the world of business investments. We want to stand by and promote those businesses by highlighting them.
    Each diverse business has its own personalized, dynamically created page that shows business growth, expenses, and revenue.
    - Investors can choose to invest in any of the businesses shown. They also receive an investment credit of $10 as an incentive from us!

> Our goal is to make investing fun and create inclusion within the community.
